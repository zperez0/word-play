## Technologies Used

## Description

_Created a webpage where a user can input a sentence into a word generator. It will reverse the characters and display a new string back to the user._

## Setup/Installation Requirements

* _Clone this repository to your desktop_
* _Navigate to the top level of the directory._
* _open word-play/index.html_
* _drag and drop into browser._

## Known Bugs

* _The loop is supposed to build a new array out of every word in the sentence that is three or more characters in length. However, it reads all the characters, no matter the length, and displays the original input in reverse to the user. I am working on fixing this error._
